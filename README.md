# rpi-led

This is a project I have been working on since 2018. It is for a LED light strip to be driven by a Raspberry Pi. While I have "borrowed" a few snippets of code here and there, this work is almost entirely my own. It features lots of cool effects and the ability to manage alarms. Plus its mobile friendly too. More info to come later.
